---

This licence covers **this project's own** code, configuration and original art.
It does not cover, and this project does not redistribute, any Halo game asset.

The release also bundles `plugins\CutsceneDetectionPlugin.dll` (cutscene comfort), which is
**elliotttate's** work (https://github.com/elliotttate), not ours, and so is not covered by the MIT
licence above. It is a standalone UEVR plugin that UEVR loads separately -- it is not linked into
this project's code, and neither is a derivative of the other.

The UEVR plugin SDK headers this project builds against are © praydog and are
**not** vendored here — they are fetched from https://github.com/praydog/UEVR at
build time under their own terms. See COMPILING.md.

`src\thirdparty\openvr.h` is vendored from Valve's OpenVR SDK
(https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr), © Valve Corporation, used under the
**BSD-3-Clause** licence reproduced below. It is used to display the cutscene hint
overlay through SteamVR; `openvr_api.dll` is never bundled — it is loaded at runtime
from the player's own SteamVR installation when present.
