// WHAT PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
//
// Any RVA or struct offset written into source is a measurement of ONE build. It rots when the
// target ships a patch and was never valid for a different store's binary of the same game. The
// failure is silent: hooking is positional, so installing on a stale address SUCCEEDS and reports
// success, and reads of unrelated memory usually pass a range check.
//
// The normal answer is a cascade -- try a signature, fall back to a recorded address, fall back to
// some other resolver, finally give up into a degraded-but-working mode. The problem with cascades
// is that every rung below the first only ever executes when something is already broken, so on a
// healthy machine NONE of them run and they rot unobserved. Building the fallback is not the same
// as knowing it works.
//
// So this library is deliberately NOT another pattern scanner (kananlib and friends already do that
// better). It is the VERIFICATION layer that tends to be missing:
//
//   Signature          find by shape, and refuse an AMBIGUOUS match rather than taking the first
//   scan_string /      anchor on a string literal or on the code that REFERENCES a known address --
//     scan_reference     both survive recompilation better than a raw byte pattern
//   FaultMask          force any single rung to fail, on a healthy machine, so the rung BELOW it
//                        can be watched doing its job
//   HookWatchdog       "installed" is not "running" -- catch an address that is never called
//   CoVariation        validate a DATA offset, which no code-signature check can do
//

//   it is that a field was inserted and your offset now lands on the NEIGHBOURING field of the same
//   hot struct, which moves just as much as the one you wanted.
//
// So when the candidate should EQUAL a reference you already have (after whatever transform relates
// them), test that instead. Measured on a real target: the correct field agreed with its reference
// to 0.01 degrees, while the neighbouring field 4 bytes away differed by 139. That is not a
// marginal signal.
